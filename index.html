                <h3>💡 What Drives Me</h3>
                <img src="Coding.jpg" alt="Coding">
                <p>I'm passionate about technology, design, and continuous learning — three areas that constantly inspire me to explore new ideas and push my boundaries. I enjoy diving into web development, experimenting with new tools and frameworks, and finding creative ways to solve real-world problems through code and design.</p>
                
                <p>For me, technology isn't just about functionality; it's about creating meaningful, user-centered experiences that make life easier, more efficient, and more enjoyable.</p>
                
                <h3>🚀 Learning by Doing</h3>
                <img src="Learning.jpeg" alt="Learning">
                <p>I believe that the best way to learn is by doing. Whether it's building a website from scratch, collaborating on a group project, or exploring new technologies, I always try to learn through hands-on experience. Every project teaches me something new — not just about programming or design, but also about teamwork, communication, and turning ideas into reality.</p>
                
                <h3>🎓 My Journey at UTHM</h3>
                <img src="UTHM Campus.jpeg" alt="UTHM Campus">
                <p>Studying at Universiti Tun Hussein Onn Malaysia (UTHM) has been a wonderful journey of discovery and growth. Throughout my time here, I've gained valuable technical and soft skills through classes, labs, and real-world projects. I've also had the opportunity to participate in various campus events, workshops, and group activities that have helped me strengthen my problem-solving abilities and build lasting connections with my peers.</p>
                
                <h3>🎯 My Goals</h3>
                <img src="Future Goals.jpg" alt="Future Goals">
                <p>My ultimate goal is to use what I learn to create impactful digital solutions that can make a difference — both within the UTHM community and beyond. I'm especially interested in how technology can improve accessibility, education, and everyday life, and I aspire to contribute to projects that align with these values.</p>
